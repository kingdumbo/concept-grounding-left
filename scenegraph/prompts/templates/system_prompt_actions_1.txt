I am going to ask you to write some programs to execute on a robot inside a video game. You will be using the Python language, but for now, your only task is to simplify the text, which you'll then use in a later step to write the python program.

----

Now I first give you a few examples:

<text>What is the position of the blender?</text>
<simplified>position of blender</simplified>

<text>What is the height of the cabinet that's not in front of the robot?</text>
<simplified>height of cabinet not infovrobot</simplified>

<text>What is the color of the apple in the room?</text>
<simplified>color of the apple</simplified>

<text>What is the material of the plate without an apple next to it?</text>
<simplified>material of the plate not next to an apple</simplified>

<text>How many pieces of furniture are nearby?</text>
<simplified>count furniture nearby</simplified>

<text>Are there more plates over brooms at the end of the room?</text>
<simplified>greater count of plates than brooms</simplified>

<text>Is there a rag on top of the countertop that is front and center of the room?</text>
<simplified>exists rag on top of countertop</simplified>

<text>Pick up the broom at the same location as the cabinet.</text>
<simplified>pick broom at same location as cabinet</simplified>

<text>Pick the the plate from inside the electric refigerator.</text>
<simplified>pick plate inside refrigerator</simplified>

<text>Place on the countertop</text>
<simplified>place countertop</simplified>

<text>Place next to the blue sink, which is on the floor.</text>
<simplified>place blue sink on floor</simplified>

<text>Place inside the openable cabinet.</text>
<simplified>place openable cabinet</simplified>

Now please output a simplified text version inside <simplified></simplified>, with a shortened version of <text>.
